ETL tools scenarios:
    Data warehousing - centralized repo of all data 
    Data Migration - Migrate data from legacy system to new repo schema 
    Business intelligence - Dashboards and reports 
    Real time data monitoring 
    Social media data analysed for trends - Transform for analysis and load to hadoop or data lake 

ETL vs ELT:
    ETL - Transformation in intermediate staging area or ETL server 
        - Involves batch processing - data latency in loading 
        - Confidentiality or anonymity of data - first transformed then stored 
        - Ex: 
            - Retail customer 360
            - Financial analysis in bank 
    ELT - Transformation in the target system , leverages processing power of target system 
        - Supports both batch and real time processing 
        - not enough transforming power in transforming system - go for ELT 
        - Ex: 
            - Social media trends using real time data - sentiment analysis 
            - Global e-commerce stores raw data in lake and analyses trends accordingly 

SSIS vs ADF:
    SSIS: 
        - Old - came first
        - Not cloud based  
        - On premise
        - source and dest are limited
        - Integrated with SQL server 
        - cases needing complex, server-based ETL processes 
        - Not veru scalable - can do vertical scaling
        - Used by companies who can't move their data completely to cloud as of yet 

    ADF:
        - New one 
        - Cloud based 
        - can accomodate multiple sources and destinations 
        - Cloud native tool - cloud and on-premise data 
        - More flexible 
        - Highly scalable - horizontal scaling 
        - Integrates seemlessly with other Azure services 
        - cases where there is need to manage large-scale, hybrid, or cloud-only data workflows

ADF vs Talend:
    ADF: 
        - Organized around activities and datasets 
        - Data transformation - using data flow activities or external services like azure databricks 
    
    Talend:
        - Organized around components 
        - Components are functions. Multiple components join together to form a job 
        - Built in transformation components 
        - Java and python to transform data 

Talend  - when u want to work with data from unexplored sources 
        - less know data sources and targets
ADF     - when mostly from Azure
